## Overview
MovieApp is a dynamic mobile application that utilizes TheMovieDB API to display a list of movies and their details. Designed to operate efficiently both online and offline, it fetches data from the API when connected to the internet and retrieves cached data from a local database when offline, ensuring uninterrupted user experience. The application supports pagination, seamlessly integrating data fetched both from remote servers and cached locally.

## Technologies Used
- **MVVM Architecture**: Structuring the app using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to manage data flow and application logic efficiently.
- **Retrofit & OkHttp**: Handling network operations for consuming RESTful services, optimized for robustness and performance.
- **Room**: Utilizing SQLite for local data persistence and efficient caching. This setup allows for quick data access and minimizes dependency on network connectivity.
- **Hilt - Dagger**: Implementing dependency injection to decouple the construction of objects from their usage, making the app more modular and testable.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifying in-app navigation, enhancing the user interface with predictable and consistent user interactions.
- **Gson**: Parsing JSON data with minimal overhead, integrated seamlessly into the data management layers of the app.
- **Glide**: Efficient image loading and caching, improving the performance and responsiveness of the app by handling image resources smartly.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Managing asynchronous tasks, making the handling of concurrent operations smooth and efficient.
- **Kotlin Flow & ViewModel**: Utilizing Flow for reactive data streaming and ViewModel to maintain data across configuration changes, directing UI updates accurately.

## Features
- Movie Listings: Browse through a list of movies with options to load more on demand.
- Caching: Automatic data caching to provide a seamless user experience during offline access.
- Seamless Pagination: Integrated pagination that works uniformly with both remote and cached data sources.
